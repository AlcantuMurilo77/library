# Library Management System

This is a simple Library Management System built with **Flask**, **Python**, and **SQL**. The application offers basic features such as adding, deleting, and listing books, along with user management and data validation to ensure integrity and consistency.

---

## Features

- **Book Management**  
  Add, delete, and list books in the library.

- **User Management**  
  Register and manage users in the system.

- **Data Validation**  
  Utilizes Marshmallow to ensure only valid data is processed, with clear error messages.

- **RESTful API**  
  Built using REST principles for clean and organized API structure.

- **Database Integration**  
  All data is stored and validated in a relational SQL database.

## How It Works

The system manages a collection of books using a RESTful API. Each book entry includes attributes like title, author, and release year, stored in a database. Users can register and interact with the system, while an admin manages the books. All input data is validated before being accepted.
